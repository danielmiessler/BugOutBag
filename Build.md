# Philosophy Revisited

Again, the goal is not to get silly with this. I'm only trying to do some due diligence vs. some high probability, short-duration disruptions, such as a natural disaster, or a major overreaction to one or more terrorist attacks. I'm basically guarding against people completely losing their shit for no reason and cleaning out all the food and water stores nearby. Plus it may be unsafe to be out in the street for a bit.

My basic rule is to have a two week buffer in the case of something minor going down, with my goal of getting to a safe place where I can last longer if required. Anything beyond that, well, I don't think this type of list is going to help.

On to it then.
