# Philosophy Revisited

Again, the goal is not to get silly with this. I'm only trying to do some due diligence vs. some high probability, short-duration disruptions, such as a natural disaster, or a major overreaction to one or more terrorist attacks. I'm basically guarding against people completely losing their shit for no reason and cleaning out all the food and water stores nearby. Plus it may be unsafe to be out in the street for a bit.

My basic rule is to have a two week buffer in the case of something minor going down, with my goal of getting to a safe place where I can last longer if required. Anything beyond that, well, I don't think this type of list is going to help.

On to it then.

## First Aid
<!-- In my opinion its impossible to have a perfect first aid Kit. With this in mind I prefer to have different levels of kits a personal every day IFAK, a car kit with some extended capabilities and then a fairly comprehensive home kit. What I have listed here are the base kits that I have augmented fairly extensively to make kits I am fairly happy with. -->
- Medication Kits | https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PZ1SPW3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
    ``` 
        Buy these OTC medications in fullsized bottles to keep at home fill 
        the above containers and make a kit for your car and laptop bag. 
        That way you always have what you need and have the bottles at home to keep everything refilled.

        ❏ Ibuprofen
        ❏ Acetaminophen
        ❏ Loratadine
        ❏ Dimethylhydrine
        ❏ Docusate Sodium
        ❏ Loperamide
        ❏ Bismuth Subsalicylate
        ❏ Activated Charcoal
        ❏ Caffeine

        Liquid Skin and Leukotape together can handle pretty much everything you would ever use a bandaid for 
        but allow you to cut to the size you need instead of running out of the correct sized bandages.

## Clothing

Nothing here yet; need to figure out what to do.

## Weapons
<!--packing a lot of weight on ammo. If you expect to need to use it then by all means. I personally carry 2 loaded extra mags and 1 extra 50rnd box in my pack for my pistol. I carry a .380 for weight and concealability reasons. might consider adding a carbine if your expecting that much urban combat.-->
